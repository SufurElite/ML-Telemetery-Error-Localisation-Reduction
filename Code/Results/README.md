# ML-Telemetery-Error-Localisation-Reduction
A repository worked on and developed as part of the Quadrat summer research program with the University of Aberdeen researching the use of machine learning to reduce localisation errors in automated telemetry, particularly CTT, systems.

For further info about the different parts of project read the relevant subdirectory READMEs.

And the Useful References.txt file has a list of Bibtex citations of relevant papers that were found useful as we worked on the project.

## To-Do
- [ ] Write a custom sequential model 
- [ ] Explore the current data to see why the association /loadData functions are producing comparatively little results (in terms of number of rows)/ensure that the number they are producing does make sense
- [ ] Write a plot function that has the same plots as before but includes the model's prediction rather than the calculate one
