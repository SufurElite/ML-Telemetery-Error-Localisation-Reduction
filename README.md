# ML-Telemetery-Error-Localisation-Reduction
A repository worked on and developed as part of the Quadrat summer research program with the University of Aberdeen researching the possible use of machine learning to reduce localisation errors in automated telemetry systems.

## To-Do
- [ ] Write a custom sequential model 
- [ ] Explore the current data to see why the association functions are producing comparatively little results (in terms of number of rows)
- [ ] Write a plot function that has the same plots as before but includes the model's prediction on top of it
